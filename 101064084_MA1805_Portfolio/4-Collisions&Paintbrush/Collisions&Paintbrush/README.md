# The DVD logo - that never hits the corner

based on the old DVD screensaver that famously would only occasionally hit exactly into the corner of the screen. 

I plan to make a very basic version of this logo and have it change colour upon each collision with the edge of frame.

I also want to write into the code that it never actually perfectly hits the corner. I'll use an If/then solution to amend the coordiates of the logo it is ever about to be in the corner
