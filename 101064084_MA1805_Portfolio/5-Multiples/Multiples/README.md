# Falling Traffic Lights

I want to expand on the falling rectangle exercise and have them represent traffic signals. On each mouse click, the colour of the falling shape will change in sequence(red yellow green)

when red, the shapes stop moving
when yellow, the shapes move slowly
when green, the shapes move at full speed
