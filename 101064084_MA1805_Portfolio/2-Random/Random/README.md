# To Make It Echo

My piece will randomly generate all words from a passage by Alan Watts on the 'eternal now' on a loop

The lines will appear in random points on the canvas
in reference to the fleeting nature of time referenced in the passage - see passage below

The page will also loop continously in reference to the line 'to make it echo'

## On the one hand, you let go of everything
## And you live in the eternal now
## Because that's all there is
## See, memory is an illusion, it's all gone

## So, everything you know about
## That makes an impression on you, is no longer there
## Thatâ€™s the meaning of Maya
## There is only the eternal now
## There's only the present moment
## And never will be anything else

## Because, even what you're remembering
## Is happening in the present
## The memory is in the eternal now, isn't it?
## See, so it's all really absolutely here
## But on the other hand, what fun?

## To drag it out
## And to make it echo
## And to get involved
## And to fall in love
## And to become attached
## It's just like riding a bicycle
## It's a balance trick ##
